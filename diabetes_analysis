/* Diabetes Dataset Analysis */

/*Dataset Summary*/
--How many records are within the dataset
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records from diabetes;
--769 

--How many diabetic and non diabetic patients are in the dataset
-- 0 being non-diabetic 1  being diabetic
SELECT outcome, COUNT(*) as result from diabetes group by outcome;
--500 non diabetics, 268 diabetics

--Average age of patients within the dataset
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age),2) as average_age from diabetes;
--Avg age is 33.2

/*Correlation and relationships within the dataset*/
--Average BMI for diabetic and non diabetic patients
SELECT outcome, ROUND(AVG(BMI),2) from diabetes GROUP by outcome
--Non diabetics BMI is 30.3 and for diabetics is 35.14

--Does pregnancies affect likehihood of diabetes 
SELECT pregnancies, ROUND(AVG(outcome),2) as likelihood_diabetes from diabetes group by pregnancies order by likelihood_diabetes ASC
--The more pregnancies result more in the likelihood of diabetes 

--Finding the average gluclose level for each age group
SELECT CASE

--18-30 had the lowest gluclose levels, while the above 50+ had the highest avg gluclose level

--Sorting patients based on BMI and calculate the percentage of diabetics in each group
SELECT CASE
	WHEN bmi < 18.5 then 'underweight'
